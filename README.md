# Java RESTful API

A small project aimed at learning a new language (Java), a new framework (Spring Boot), and new coding patterns, as well as further exploring object oriented programming, a programming paradigm that has always sparked my curiosity.

## How it works

This project has been set up with Spring Boot and is being built following the controller-service-repository pattern.

A Postgres database has been connected through Spring Boot and is being managed with [Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.com/).
